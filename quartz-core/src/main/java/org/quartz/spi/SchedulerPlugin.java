 * <p>
 * Provides an interface for a class to become a "plugin" to Quartz.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Plugins can do virtually anything you wish, though the most interesting ones
 * will obviously interact with the scheduler in some way - either actively: by
 * invoking actions on the scheduler, or passively: by being a <code>JobListener</code>,
 * <code>TriggerListener</code>, and/or <code>SchedulerListener</code>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you use <code>{@link org.quartz.impl.StdSchedulerFactory}</code> to
 * initialize your Scheduler, it can also create and initialize your plugins -
 * look at the configuration docs for details.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you need direct access your plugin, you can have it explicitly put a 
 * reference to itself in the <code>Scheduler</code>'s 
 * <code>SchedulerContext</code> as part of its
 * <code>{@link #initialize(String, Scheduler)}</code> method.
